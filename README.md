## How to start a development server in your Project

```bash
pnpm dev -o
```

The command pnpm dev -o is used to start a development server in your project. The dev script is a default script that is defined in the package.json file of most JavaScript projects. It is used to start a development server that will watch your files for changes and automatically rebuild your project whenever a change is made. The -o flag tells pnpm to open the development server in a web browser.
